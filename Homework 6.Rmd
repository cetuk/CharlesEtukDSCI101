1. You are playing Dungeons and Dragons. You are an Elf named Steve and you come up against a Orc named Mobrukk Pride Bruiser. You must battle. In order to defeat the Mobrukk you must do the following:

(a) Roll a 6 sided die and call this number n.
```{r}
n <- sample(1:6, 1)
n
```
(b) You now get n 20 sided dice and you roll all of them. You defeat the Mobrukk if ANY of the n 20 sided die display a prime number. What is the probability that you defeat Mobrukk?
```{r}
primes <- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19)
anyprimes <- function(i){
  any(sample(1:20,n, replace = TRUE) %in% primes)
}
results <- map_dbl(1:1000000,anyprimes)
mean(results)

cat("The probability of rolling a prime number on at least one of", n, "20-sided dice is", mean(results))
```
